== README
To Self:
Here are important notes to remember always but especially if you clone down this branch again for some reason. 

Don't forget...restart your server any time you change your environment variables because your server will but unaware of those changes until you restart it. 

Also, something to note: everytime you clone this app to a new computer you will not have the application.yml file. Be sure to add documentation as a reminder to your README.md on how to run the Figaro generator and add your environment variables
